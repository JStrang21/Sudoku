# Sudoku
This is a project for EECS 1510. Use java to create a sudoku reader which accepts 2d 9x9 matrices(incomplete boards) and outputs the completed board with information about what was completed. The project is intended to use the concepts learned so far in the semester with 2d arrays being especially important.
